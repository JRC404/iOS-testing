# Reasons for this project and what to cover

I have always wanted to dive deeper into iOS testing and it is my mission to add more functionality to the iOS section of the Master Coding course at my work. Here, I'll be documenting my findings.

## Testing

### Why test?

1. Code confidence
2. Bug fixes
3. Refactoring code without breaking functionality
4. Higher quality code
5. Documentation?

If functionality changes, your tests will need to be updated. You'll be moving slower but you'll spend less time tracking down bugs.

### What makes a good test?

1. Repeatable... it needs to be able to pass.
2. Fast - integration. Multiple developers need to be able to test quickly
3. Maintainable
4. Manual testing sometimes needs to happen - checking to see if something works quickly
5. Integration testing.
