        Objects - tracking changes, forcing them to be efficient
        Undo / redo - cmd + z, but you can't do that with data?
            NSFetchedResult - UITableView -> putting all the data retrieved into a tableView
            -> Tracking changes
            -> Group / display data, splitting up into sections
            -> Cache - iOS, being able to pull data efficiently
            -> Background processing, what does this mean? How do we achieve it?
            -> Data models, what is a data model? Can we link it back to previous projects in other languages? (Hopefully.)
